What is the pipeline flow?

1) Initialization: create a FactChecker object

2) Document Retrieval: calls src/retrieval --> find relevant documents from the entire corpus.

3) Sentence Ranking: calls src/sentence_ranker --> extracts all sentences from these documents,
                                                   obtain the bests.
4) Natural Language Inference: calls src/nli --> uses the highly efficient batch inference module, 
                                                obtain res, 

                                                +) eg: [{sentence: "...", label: "SUPPORT", score: 0.92}, ...] 

5) Evidence Aggregation: calls src/aggregation --> obtains scorings from result of previous steps,
                                                    provides ULTIMATE VERDICT.
                                                    
                                                +) eg:  {verdict: "REFUTED", final_score: -0.75, evidence: [...]}
